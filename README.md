# loam_velodyne

This is a LOAM (Lidar Odometry and Mapping) ROS package for Velodyne VLP-16 3D laser scanner. This package is a simple modified copy of [loam_velodyne git repository](https://github.com/daobilige-su/loam_velodyne) from **daobilige-su**, who fixed a bug on laserOdometry.cpp to get rid of the matrix NaN error during L-M optimization step. Please cite Zhang et al.'s paper if this package is used.

# how to use
Check https://github.com/laboshinl/loam_velodyne 

# what I am doing
- Add some comments based on others and what I took for.
- Rename it to "loam_velodyne_vance" so that I can use it and its original version in the same time.
- Make it available for KITTI dateset. (no good result by now, still ongoing)
